## Report a Bug ##

This is the easiest way to report any problems you are having and can be found at the bottom of the Settings menu. It will automatically generate required information and all you need to do is describe your problem.

## Issue Tracking ##

Another good way to report a problem is to use the Issue Tracker from this site. Fill out <a href='http://code.google.com/p/ap-kings-in-the-corner/issues/entry'>the form here</a> to do so. This can also be used to make feature suggestions.

## Email ##

If the above options don't work for you, you can also send an email to asparagus.programs@gmail.com or use the email link on the Android Market.

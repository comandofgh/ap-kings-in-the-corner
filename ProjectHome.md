# Kings in the Corner #

The not so popular, but still kind of fun, multi-player card game!

Developed by <a href='http://asparagusprograms.wordpress.com/'>Asparagus Programs</a> for Android 1.6 and higher.

## New Beta available! ##
A beta download for version 2.0.0 can be found under the <a href='http://code.google.com/p/ap-kings-in-the-corner/downloads/list'>downloads</a> tab. The beta builds use a different package name and thus will not currently replace the market version. Works for Android 1.6+

Starting with 2.0.0-beta6, you can check for and download updates directly from the game's Settings rather than having to check this site. You can also set it to check only for official releases (excluding betas), in case you're on a device that doesn't have access to Google Play Store and don't want to participate in the betas (currently there are no official 2.0.0 releases).

<b>Beta details:</b>
  * Tablet optimization with higher resolution cards that scale to fit the screen better
  * Performance improvements
  * Animations
  * and more

Code for versions 1.5.81 and older can be found in /branches/old. The code for version 2.0.0+ will be added to /trunk after it has been cleaned up.

## Latest Release Changes ##

**Version 1.5.81**
